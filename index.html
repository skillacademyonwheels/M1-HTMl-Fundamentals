    <h1>HTML Structure</h1>
    This is a simple HTML document to demonstrate the structure of an HTML file. It includes a title, a heading, and some text content.<br>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</p><br>
    <p>HTML elements are represented by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used for main headings, and the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is used for paragraphs.</p><br>
