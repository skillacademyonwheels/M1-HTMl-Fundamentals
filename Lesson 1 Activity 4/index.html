    <h1>Hi ! I am Penguin </h1><br>

    <p>I am Penguin. </p><br> I amknown for my black and white feathers and my ability to swim. Penguins are flightless
    birds that are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. They are known for their
    distinctive waddling walk and their social behavior, often living in large colonies.</p><br>
    <p>Penguins are excellent swimmers, using their wings as flippers to propel themselves through the water. They
        primarily feed on fish, squid, and krill, diving deep into the ocean to catch their prey. Penguins are also
        known for their unique courtship rituals and parenting behaviors, where they take turns incubating eggs and
        feeding their chicks.</p><br>
